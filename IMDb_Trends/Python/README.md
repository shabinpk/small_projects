# Python Analysis

This folder contains the Python-based data cleaning and visualization steps for the IMDb dataset.

## 📌 Steps
1. Data cleaning & transformation (removing unwanted columns, fixing types)
2. Feature engineering (Decade, Rating Category, Runtime Category)
3. Visualizations:
   - Average Runtime by Runtime Category
   - Average Rating by Rating Category
   - Movie Count by Decade
   - Average Rating by Decade
   - IMDb Rating vs Metascore Scatter
   - Correlation Heatmap
