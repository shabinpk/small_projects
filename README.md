# Small Data Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of small-scale data analysis projects completed during my Power BI and Python learning journey. Each folder represents an individual mini-project involving data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. These projects helped reinforce concepts such as EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), handling missing values, feature engineering, and creating basic dashboards or visual outputs.

## Project Structure

- Each project is organized in its own subfolder.
- Files include:
  - Raw datasets (where applicable)
  - Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks used for cleaning and analysis
  - Power BI dashboards (.pbix files)
  - A `README.md` per project outlining objectives, techniques, and learnings
  - Notes and observations are often added as comments within the code

## Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc.)
- **Power BI**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and portfolio building

## Acknowledgements

Some parts of the workflow, improvements, and documentation were done with the assistance of **ChatGPT** for clarification, refactoring, and markdown formatting.

Feel free to explore each folder to see practical applications of beginner to intermediate data analysis tasks.
