# Small Data Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of small-scale data analysis projects completed as part of my structured learning journey through a data institute program, along with self-practice. Each project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python and Power BI. Over time, I will expand this repository to include projects built with SQL, Tableau, and Excel—bringing together a mix of tools as my learning progresses.

## Project Structure

- Each project is organized in its own subfolder.
- Files include:
  - Raw datasets (where applicable)
  - Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks used for cleaning and analysis  
    ⚠️ **Note**: File paths in the code often point to my system directories. If you clone this repository, please adjust the paths before running.
  - Power BI dashboards (.pbix files)
  - A `README.md` per project outlining objectives, techniques, and learnings
  - Notes and observations added as comments within the code

## Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc.)
- **Power BI**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and portfolio building  
- *(Future additions)* **SQL**, **Tableau**, **Excel**

## Contact

- **LinkedIn**: [shabinpengad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shabinpengad)

## Acknowledgements

Some parts of the workflow, improvements, and documentation were refined with the assistance of **ChatGPT** for clarification, refactoring, and markdown formatting.

Feel free to explore each folder to see practical applications of beginner-to-intermediate data analysis tasks. As my learning continues, this repository will serve as a portfolio of my growth across different tools and technologies.
